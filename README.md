# XIV on Mac
Wine Wrapper, Setup tool and alternative launcher for FFXIV on MacOS.

---

<b>"XIV on Mac"</b> is a team of collaborators and Mac gamers with the sole objective to provide an alternative method of running
FFXIV on MacOS while providing better performance/support than Square Enix's native MacOS launcher. <b>This project is 100% open source.</b>

---

Our initial project started by using Crossover with updated library files to provide a better experience in FFXIV on MacOS as well as supporting Apple's latest M1 processer.
You can read our depreciated Crossover setup guide <a href="https://github.com/seathasky/FF14-MAC_ModSupport">here.</a> 
In December of 2021, the <b>XIV on Mac</b> 
team decided to make the project more user friendly by providing our own standalone MacOS application/launcher.
